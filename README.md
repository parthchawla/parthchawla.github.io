I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Economics at the University of California, Davis, with research interests in economic development, firm productivity and resilience, human capital, machine learning, and migration. I also currently work as a Consultant with the World Bank’s East Asia and Pacific Chief Economist’s Office and have previously worked with the Poverty and Equity Global Practice.

### Working Papers

- Chawla, P. 2025. "Can Human Capital Improve Firm Resilience in Financial Crises? Evidence from the 1997 Indonesian Crisis". Working paper. [SSRN Link](https://ssrn.com/abstract=5257343)    
  <small style="font-size:90%">Summary: Do returns to human capital rise during crises? This paper examines whether Indonesia’s INPRES school construction program in the 1970s improved firm resilience during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. I use a diff-in-diff strategy combined with a shift-share instrument, exploiting variation in district-level INPRES intensity and the national share of fully treated cohorts in the working-age population. Results show that INPRES significantly improved post-crisis plant performance: each additional INPRES school per 1,000 children increased labor productivity and output by 2.8 and 3.5 percent, respectively. I find that these gains were likely driven by INPRES-exposed plants retaining better-educated workers during the crisis.</small>

World Bank, Washington, D.C. [Link](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099439111272329963/pdf/IDU0ed4d6e61077f404936080040a13f92c09683.pdf)    
  <small style="font-size:90%">Summary: This paper applies a machine learning-based survey-to-survey imputation method (SWIFT-plus) to estimate poverty in Afghanistan after the Taliban's return to power in August 2021. A model trained on the 2019/20 Expenditure and Labor Force Survey is used to predict household consumption in the 2023 Afghanistan Welfare Monitoring Survey. Results show that 48.3 percent of the population was poor as of April to June 2023, a 4 percentage point decline since 2020, driven by falling rural poverty while urban poverty remained stagnant.</small>
