I am a PhD student in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Davis. My research interests lie in development and agricultural economics. I am also a consultant at the World Bank.

Before pursuing my PhD, I was a Research Associate at Harvard Kennedy School's Evidence for Policy Design, conducting field experiments in rural India. Beyond my expertise in economics and policy evaluation, I have substantial experience in data science and I'm proficient in Python, R, and SQL.
