I am a Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Davis. My research focuses on economic development, firm productivity and resilience, migration, and applied machine learning. I also currently work as a Consultant with the World Bank’s East Asia and Pacific Chief Economist’s Office and have previously worked with the Poverty and Equity Global Practice.

I am interested in the drivers of private sector development, particularly in developing countries, including how skills, trade, supply chains, and digital adoption affect firm productivity and resilience to shocks. My work applies advanced causal inference and machine learning methods to study these themes across a range of contexts. I am also interested in cross-border and rural-to-urban migration, especially Mexico–US labor flows, and how climate, economic, and policy-related shocks affect migration patterns.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Research Associate at Evidence for Policy Design (Harvard Kennedy School), leading field research in India. I hold a Master's in Economics from Trinity College Dublin and a Bachelor's in Physics from Royal Holloway, University of London.

I am on the 2025-26 job market.

  Do returns to human capital rise during crises? This paper examines whether Indonesia’s INPRES school construction program in the 1970s improved firm resilience during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. I use a difference-in-differences strategy combined with a shift-share instrument, exploiting variation in district INPRES intensity and the national share of treated working-age cohorts. The results show that each additional school per 1,000 children increased post-crisis labor productivity and output by 2.8 and 3.5 percent, respectively. These gains were likely driven by INPRES-exposed plants benefiting from an abundant local supply of skilled production workers, which helped keep wages lower and allowed them to retain more educated workers during the crisis.

  <small style="font-size:90%">
  This paper uses a machine learning-based survey-to-survey imputation method (SWIFT-plus) to estimate poverty in Afghanistan following the Taliban’s return to power in August 2021. A model trained on the 2019/20 Expenditure and Labor Force Survey is used to predict household consumption in the 2023 Afghanistan Welfare Monitoring Survey, a phone survey drawn from the same sampling frame. The results show that 48.3 percent of the population was poor as of April-June 2023, a 4 percentage point decline since the same months in 2020. This decline was driven by falling rural poverty, while urban poverty remained unchanged.

### Selected Research in Progress

"Predicting Mexico-to-US Migration with Machine Learning for Counterfactual Analysis," with J. Edward Taylor and Siyao Wang    
Conferences: *AAEA & WAEA Joint Annual Meeting 2025*    
<details style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:-0.5em">
  <summary>Summary</summary>
  <small style="font-size:90%">
  Reliable tools to predict migration are increasingly important amid rising climate and economic risks, and demographic shifts. Tree-based machine learning models can uncover complex, nonlinear relationships that conventional models often miss and can be used to simulate responses to shocks. Migration data are costly to collect, so models must perform well with readily available data. We first train a LightGBM model on an ideal dataset, a panel tracking the employment locations of 10,739 individuals from 1980 to 2007, and achieve high predictive accuracy. Using this as a benchmark, we then train a model on just four years of data without migration histories. By adding public weather data, this restricted model approaches benchmark performance (within 0.1 F1 score). Counterfactual shocks show that a 10% rise in temperature reduces migration by 13% the following year, a 10% increase in age lowers it by 17%, and a 10% drop in income by 18%.
